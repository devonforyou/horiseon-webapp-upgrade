# Horiseon Web App
## Description
- This project focused on cleaning the HTML and CSS to be concise and readable of the Horiseon web app.
- Viewing how the code was first written up, I am able to understand where and how I could make it better.
- I was able to practice CSS selectors, debugging when I had changed the code improperly, and the scout rule leaving the code a bit cleaner than originally.

## Usage

What I was able to do with this Horiseon web app upgrade was leave the functionality the same, but made the HTML and CSS portion to visually be better. For future web app upgrades, other developers will have an easier time accessing and viewing the written code.
